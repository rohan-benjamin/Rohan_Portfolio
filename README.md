# [Project 1: Glassdoor scraper using Python and Selenium](https://github.com/rohan-benjamin/Glassdoor-Scraper-Final)

- Created a bot to scrape job details from glassdoor.com
- Used Python and the Selenium package and webdriver to automate Google Chrome to scrape data
- Bot takes the job title and the number of pages required to be scraped, as user inputs
- Collects data and publishes it into a .CSV file

# [Project 2: Mushroom Classifier Web App using Python and Streamlit](https://github.com/rohan-benjamin/Mushroom-Classifier-Web-App)

- Created a dynamic web app to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous
- Used Python to train 3 classifier models over the data - Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression
- Used Streamlit to create the UI for the app.
- Users can choose which models to use for the classification and also set the hyperparameters

# [Project 3: A/B Testing with Cookie Cats](https://github.com/rohan-benjamin/AB-Testing-with-Cookie-Cats)

- Cookie Cats is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment. It's a classic "connect three"-style puzzle game where the player must connect    tiles of the same color to clear the board and win the level.
- As players progress through the levels of the game, they will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait a non-trivial amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress. In addition to driving in-app purchases, these gates serve the important purpose of giving players an enforced break from playing the game, hopefully resulting in that the player's enjoyment of the game being increased and prolonged
- During the analysis I found strong evidence that the 7-day retention is higher when the gate is placed earlier, i.e at level 30 than when it is at level 40. The conclusion is: If we want to keep retention high — both 1-day and 7-day retention — we should not move the gate from level 30 to level 40
-  By forcing players to take a break when they reach a gate, their enjoyment of the game is prolonged. But when the gate is moved to level 40, fewer players make it far enough, and they are more likely to quit the game because they simply got bored of it.
